# Experiment 3: Challenge-Response Authentication and Replay Attack Handling

## Aim

To implement challenge-response authentication using a random nonce and shared secret, and detect replay attacks.

## Methodology

The server generates a random nonce as a challenge. The client uses the nonce and shared secret to create an HMAC-SHA256 response. The server verifies the response and rejects reused or expired challenges.

## Procedure

1. Set a shared secret between the client and server.
2. Generate a random nonce as the authentication challenge.
3. Generate an HMAC-SHA256 response using the nonce and secret.
4. Verify the response on the server.
5. Reuse the same response to simulate a replay attack.
6. Use nonce tracking and timestamps to reject replayed or expired responses.

## Tools and Techniques

- Python 3
- VS Code
- HMAC-SHA256
- `secrets`
- `time`
- Nonce generation
- Replay detection

## Result

The initial authentication was successful, while replayed and expired responses were rejected.

## Discussion

A fresh nonce prevents an old authentication response from being reused. Timestamp checking provides additional protection against delayed replay attempts.

## Improvement
One-time nonce tracking was added to detect and prevent reuse of an old challenge.

## Conclusion

The experiment successfully demonstrated challenge-response authentication and protection against replay attacks.
